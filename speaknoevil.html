       <h2>Synopsis:</h2> <br>
       <blockquote>
         <p>
            The Danish couple Bjørn and the vegetarian wife Louise and their young daughter Agnes are spending summer vacation at Tuscany, Italy. Agnes loses her stuffed rabbit Ninus and Bjørn seeks out the toy until he finds it. Soon they befriend the Dutch couple Patrick and Karin and their young son Abel, who was born without a tongue. When they return home, they receive an invitation from the Dutch couple to spend a weekend with them at their countryside house. They travel by car and after two days, Louise feels uncomfortable with the strange situations they have been submitted by the Dutch couple and convinces Bjørn to return home in the middle of the night. However, Agnes forgets to bring Ninus, and they return to the house to retrieve the toy. Patrick and Karin apologize for the wrong-doings and Bjørn and Louise decides to stay for the rest of the holiday. However, during the night, Bjørn snoops around and finds dark secrets in the house and tells Louise that they will leave immediately the house but does not disclose his discoveries to her. What have Bjørn seen in the house?
