       <h2>Synopsis:</h2> <br>
       <blockquote>
         <p>
            Gunning for revenge, outlaw Nat Love saddles up with his gang to take down enemy Rufus Buck, a ruthless crime boss who just got sprung from prison. <br>
            When outlaw Nat Love discovers that his enemy Rufus Buck is being released from prison he rounds up his gang to track Rufus down and seek revenge. Those riding with him in this assured, righteously new school Western include his former love Stagecoach Mary, his right and left hand men hot-tempered Bill Pickett and fast drawing Jim Beckwourth and a surprising adversary-turned-ally. Rufus Buck has his own fearsome crew, including "Treacherous" Trudy Smith and Cherokee Bill, and they are not a group that knows how to lose.
            The Nat Love gang are effectively reunited when they ambush the Buck gang and steal their ill-gotten gains from a bank job. Outlaw Nat Love saddles up with his gang to take down enemy Rufus Buck, leader of the Buck gang, who just got pardoned and released from jail. This brings them into a confrontation that was always going to happen, given Nat's need for payback and Buck's guilt.
