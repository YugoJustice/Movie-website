        <h2>Synopsis:</h2> <br>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            He's a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and dropped from the highest of heights, all for our entertainment. And now, fresh off an almost career-ending accident, this working-class hero has to track down a missing movie star, solve a conspiracy and try to win back the love of his life while still doing his day job. What could possibly go right? <br>
            Colt Seavers, a top-notch stunt professional sidelined after a harrowing on-set injury, is tempted out of retirement when a desperate plea pulls him back into the spotlight. But now Colt faces a heart-pounding new challenge in the name of art: he must embark on a high-stakes mission to save a film in crisis. After all, the project's superstar protagonist has gone missing, threatening the fate of a crucial directorial debut. As a result, it's up to Colt to put his skills to the ultimate test and make sure the show goes on. However, with danger lurking at every turn, can the Fall Guy pull off his finest stunt to save the day--and maybe even find love again?
